      <h2>PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS</h2><br>
      <h4>Data Cleaning and Features Selection</h4>
      <p>Since the dataset we use is a popular and widely used dataset for breast cancer prediction, we can expect that not much data cleaning is needed. However, we followed 
        through the regular steps of examining data. First, we ran a quick summary on the dataset to examine if we would see anything that is out of ordinary 
        (e.g., missing data, wrongly encoded data). There is an additional column in the dataset that has no data and therefore, we went ahead and removed the data. 
        For the analysis purpose, we have also recoded the tumor diagnosis (i.e., malignant and benign) into 1s and 0s. Additionally, we decided not to remove any outlier 
        from the analysis as we want to consider all possibilities in our analysis. For other data types such as sales data, one may want to review and consider removing any 
        observed outliers for a more robust prediction model.</p>
      <br>
      <p>There are 30 features in the breast cancer dataset. One of the methods used in feature selection is to look at the correlation between features and outcome and remove 
        any feature that has weak to no correlation with the outcome. For this purpose, we generated a correlation heatmap using all features and outcome (which is coded as 1s 
        and 0s). The correlation heatmap is also useful when examining the relationship among features. Using a coefficient threshold of .50, we ended up including 15 features 
        in the classification models.</p>

      <h2>LOGISTIC REGRESSION</h2><br>
      <h4>Similar to linear regression, logistic regression is a simple and useful technique to examine the relationship between variables, specifically in predicting 
        a categorical variable. Logistic regression is used in many fields such as disease diagnosis and flagging spam or non-spam emails.</h4>
      <p>Logistic regression algorithms use the sigmoid function in modeling data. A threshold is set to predict the class a datum belongs to. The typical threshold for 
        binary classification is 0.5. The model will then classify a tumor as benign if the value is lower than 0.5 and malignant if the value is at least 0.5.
         To learn more about logistic regression, please refer to <a href = "https://towardsdatascience.com/logistic-regression-detailed-overview-46c4da4303bc" target="_blank">
        Logistic Regression - Detailed Overview by Swaminathan</a>.</p><br>
      <p>The overall accuracy of this model is 96.06%. As we would expect, the model accuracy of our training data is slightly higher than the testing data (95.74%). 
        There are 8 inaccurate predictions (4%), with 4 FP and 4 FN. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is .95. Overall, weâ€™d conclude that Logistic Regression does a 
        pretty good job in predicting malignant tumors.</p>

      <p>It is worthy to mention that SVM model may exhibit very similar results compared to Logistic Regression model. This can happen when using SVM for linear classification. 
        As Chandrima D. from Nihilent Analytics Ltd. explains, "If your data is linearly separable...then using SVM with linear kernel will yield pretty much [the] same 
        accuracy as using L2-regularized logistic regression. The reason is: both of them use almost similar loss functions." To learn more, check out

        number of False Negatives. Sequential and Logistic Regression models once again appear at the top, predicting the lowest number of inaccurate predictions with 4 FNs
